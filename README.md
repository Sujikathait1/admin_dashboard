Welcome to the Project.

By default, this repository uses the main branch. However, to view the complete project or specific resources, you need to switch to the master branch.

How to Switch Branches on GitHub
Navigate to the repository's GitHub page.
Locate the branch dropdown menu at the top-left corner of the file list.
It should display main as the currently active branch.
Click the dropdown and select the master branch from the list of available branches.
The repository will reload, and you'll now be viewing the contents of the master branch.
